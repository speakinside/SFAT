Supervised Factor Analysis Transfer (SFAT)
=======

Supervised Factor Analysis Transfer (SFAT) is a calibration transfer algorithm, 
which uniquely integrates response variables within a probabilistic framework to transfer data 
between different instruments even with varying numbers of data features, 
and explicitly models noise variances to enhance the robustness and interpretability of calibration transfer.

### Requirements

The listed version is the Python used when developing the algorithm. Older versions might still work but are untested.

- Python == 3.11

### Python dependencies

The list below is the version of Python dependencies used when developing the algorithm. Older versions might still work but are untested.

- numpy==1.26.2
- scipy==1.11.4


### Future Plan

- add examples
- add function annotations
